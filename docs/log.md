## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them

🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week

🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This week I worked on file structure, documentation, creating issues & issue template's, setting up app router pages, and embedding sanity in Next.Js
