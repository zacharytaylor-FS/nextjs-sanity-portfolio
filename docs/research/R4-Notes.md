## Style Organization

There are different approaches to structuring CSS. May involve CSS clean-up by using some of the tips.

- **Formatting readable CSS**
  - Same line `javascript .box {background-color: #000000}`
    OR
  - `javascript
.box {
  background-color: #000000
}
`
- **Comments For CSS**
  - Add a block of comments between logical sections
    - /_ || General Styles_/
    - Comment when decisions are made for specific reason
- **Create logical sections in your stylesheet**
