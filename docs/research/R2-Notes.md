## Business Model

This document contains general notes related to validating the idea by building a business model.

## A/B Testing

What is A/B Testing? is an method where two versions of a digital assett for example a web application, app interface, or email, is tested by different user groups that figure out which is better.

- **A means Control Group**: is what you currently use that users know about already
- **Variation Group represented by B**: new or modified variable that being compared to your control
- **Developers** use A/B testing to improve features like layouts, color themes, or UI
- **Testers** use this type of testing to check if an application or website works as expected and address possible issues or bugs
- **Types of A/B Tests**
  - **Simple A/B**("two-variation test"): the goal is to figure out which variation get the best results by splitting your audience up and getting feedback.
  - **Multivariate A/B**: testing multiple variations of multiple elements on a website or applications.
  - **Split URL A/B**: two versions of a website with different URLS and at random direct visitors to one of the URLs. Good for major redesigns.
  - **Redirect**: direct a part of traffic to a different page on the same domain or different. Determine which page gets better results. Test major changes or compare completely different pages like a landing page or homepage.
  - **Server-side A/B**: test changes that cannot be made on the client side. Backend or API

## Agile Workflow

Agile project management an iterative way to manage software development projects that focuses on freqeunt released with customer feedback.

- **Agile workflow** breaks a project in phases and focuses on collaboration and imporements.
- **Agile Cycle**: Planning, Executing, and Evaluating
- **Scrum**: used to visualize progress in a a given sprint. Key component to increase transparency
- **Agile Framework(s)**
  - [Scrum]("https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/templates/kanban")
  - [Daily stand-up]("https://www.atlassian.com/en/agile/scrum/standups")
  - [Jira Kanban]("https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/templates/kanban")
- **Developers** use A/B testing to improve features like layouts, color themes, or UI
- **Testers** use this type of testing to check if an application or website works as expected and address

## Use Case

Use case is the documentation of "Actions" performed by a User and "Behaviour" from the System to the User "Actions"

- It is **`user-oriented`**: Specify 'What actions are done by the user?' and 'What the Actors see in the system?'
- It is not **`system-oriented`**: NOT specify 'What are the inputs given to a system?' and 'What are the outputs produced by the system?'
- Types of Use Cases:
  - Sunny day: are the primary cases that most likely happen when things goes well
  - Rainy Day: defined as edge cases that come after the 'Sunny Use Cases'
- Use Case Diagram are pictorial representation of a user(s) Actions in a system

## Metrics

Measuring performance gives a key metric to help evaluate the success of an app, site, or web service

- Web performance along with best practices-are key to website visitors having a good experience
- The goal is to make websites or applications faster.
- **Percieved performance** is a measure of website performance, responsiveness, and reliability.
