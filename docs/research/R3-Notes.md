A programming language that treats your code like data. Created to make it easier to analyze code and find vulnerabilities.

- Code analysis engine developed by GitHub
- **Database**: generate CodeQl database to represent code
- **Queries**: Use queries to find problems in the code
- **Alerts**: Code scanning alerts on GitHub
- Supports compiled and interpreted languages

## Creativity & Innovations

I looked at a few Creativity & Innovation topics like Digital Video, Open Access, and Test Your ISP

- **Open Access**
  - **Research available online for the public, free of $$$**
  - **Research reusable by publishing it an open licensing scheme**
- **Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR)**:
  - Bill requires any government agency with extramural( outside the walls) research budget over $100 million ensures research is placed in a public repository within 6 months on publication
