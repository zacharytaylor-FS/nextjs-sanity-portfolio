# [Concept Name]

## Application Definition Statement

_A clear high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to "What are you building?”. You will explore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here._

_Clarity over quantity should be the focus, to that end, creating visuals/charts to explain the more complex data or logical points could help to reinforce your Application’s Definition Statement._

[ Replace this text with your Application Definition Statement ]

## Target Market

_Using Primary and Secondary research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices._

_Primary Research is research that you have conducted yourself and is not based on secondary sources. Examples of Primary Research include surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This doesn't have to be formal in nature and can include discussions you have with individuals that are likely users of your application. Secondary Research is research that has been conducted by others and is based on their findings. Examples of Secondary Research include market research reports, industry publications, and news articles._

[ Replace this text with a description of any Primary and Secondary research you conducted to determine the Target Market for your application. Link to any references used during this research. ]

## User Profile / Persona

_User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market._

[ Replace this text with a User Profile / Persona for your application. If necessary, research 'Web User Persona' to generate ideas. ]

## Use Cases

_A 'Use Case' describes how a user may interact with your application. It provides a series of steps to reach a desired result. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout, how many clicks would it take to do that? Begin with a simple question like that and then map out the different steps to reach the desired goal. Use cases help us think through how our application will be used._

_Use Cases help drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. During development we regularly test and confirm the work in progress matches up with our Use Cases. This provides valuable insight into how our application is addressing the needs of the user and allows us to correct missteps early. This [article](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/use-case-testing/) gives additional background Use Cases and Use Case Testing._

[ Describe two or more Use Cases for your application. Use a bulleted list to describe the steps involved in each Use Case. ]

## Problem Statement

_In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research._

[ Replace this text with a Problem Statement for your application. Include any Research that supports your Problem Statement. ]

## Pain Points

_Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations._

[ Replace this text with a description of the Pain Points your audience is experiencing. Include any Research that supports your Pain Points. ]

## Solution Statement

_How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?_

[ Replace this text with a Solution Statement for your application. Include any Research that supports your Solution Statement. ]

## Competition

_What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own._

[ Replace this text with a description of the Competition for your application. Include any Research that supports your description. Competition can be direct or indirect. Direct competition is a product that solves the same problem as your application. Indirect competition is a product that solves a similar problem as your application. ]

## Features & Functionality

_Define key features and functionality intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key items should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points._

_A good way to identify a Key Feature is to use the phrase 'In order to [solve this problem] I need to [do this]'. For example, 'In order to listen to music while I workout I need to be able to create a playlist'._

_Features and functionality should be prioritized based on their importance to the user. This will help you focus on the most important features first and then add additional features as time allows._

[ Replace this text with a list of Key Features and Functionality for your application. Include a description of each feature and how it will solve a specific problem or pain point. For example, 'Playlist: The user will have the ability to create a playlist of songs they want to listen to while working out. This will allow them to listen to the music they want to hear while working out.' ]

## Integrations

_Use of an API is expected. This can be 3rd party APIs, your own API, or a combination of data sets. Identify which integrations are planned for and outline how you will use them transformatively. For 3rd party APIs provide links to their respective documentation and verify that your intended use complies with their Terms of Service._
