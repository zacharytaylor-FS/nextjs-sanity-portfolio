During this milestone, I will be working on finalizing a prototype that will present final visual details of the app. The prototype will be in Figma initially. As a personal challenge, I may also develop some of the front-end code, to show basic click-through functionality. 

### Use Case Testing

[Create a checklist based upon each use case defined in your project proposal and ensure that the PR submission addresses each use case]

Example: The Prototype demonstrates:

* Users are able to post to social media...
  * [ ] New users able to create accounts
    * [ ] New users are able to log out
  * [ ] Existing users able to log in
    * [ ] Existing users can close their browser without terminating their authenticated session
      * [ ] Authenticated user can navigate to and create post
      * [ ] Authenticated user can successfully share post to social media

### Things I might struggle with...
