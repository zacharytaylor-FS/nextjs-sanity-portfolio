During this milestone, I will be ensuring that each element and feature of my design is present in my application and conforms to my design and provided feedback.

### Beta Release Internal Audit

This will be your master testing list for the entirety of the application and much of this will be copy/pasted from previous milestones.

> Edit/Update this Milestone after submission of your Alpha Release to incorporate any changes between your project planning and actual development.
