During this milestone, I will begin work on initial design in Figma. This design will demonstrate key views for my proposed app (see "Pages to Design" below). I will begin with Low Fidelity Wireframes, as rough draft work. I will then enhance this work over the next several weeks, increasingly adding detail and design to the work while also addressing any feedback received. By the end of this month my design will be in High Fidelity, to demonstrate what the final app when developed should look like.  
 

### UI Kit:
I will be using the following Visual Frameworks (VF) and UI kits: [insert one ui kit and one VF link here]

Example VFs
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) 
- [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/)

*If you choose a VF that has both a UI kit for Figma and react components, this will significantly speed up your design and build time.*
