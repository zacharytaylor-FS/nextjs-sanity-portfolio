During this milestone, I will be working on creating my migrations, models, seed data, validation, and CRUD.

###  Models:
[Use this issue to add a list of all models and their properties with data types and validation]

Example:
1. Quiz
  - id (uuid, uuidV1)
  - name (string, notNull, minLength: 5)
  - type (enum['private', 'public'], notNull, in: ['private', 'public'])

### Validation

  - TBD

### Associations
